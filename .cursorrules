# Git Commit Rules

- NEVER mention claude, ai, or any assistant in commits
- keep messages casual and sloppy like typed fast
- ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS EVER in commit messages
- no fancy formatting, markdown, or special characters
- just describe what changed briefly in plain text
- lowercase preferred, quick and dirty
