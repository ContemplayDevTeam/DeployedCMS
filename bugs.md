new bug: Intermittent Network Connectivity Issues

**Error:** Network timeouts and connection resets during Cloudinary uploads

**Symptoms:**
- `ECONNRESET` errors during upload to Cloudinary
- Uploads sometimes take 79+ seconds before failing
- `TypeError: fetch failed` with connection reset

**Location:** `app\upload\page.tsx` during Cloudinary upload process

**✅ RESOLUTION APPLIED:**
Enhanced network error handling with graceful retry logic and user-friendly error messages:

**Improvements Made:**
1. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** - `app/api/upload/route.ts:4-37`
   - Automatic retry for network errors (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, ENOTFOUND)
   - 3 retry attempts with 2-second base delay
   - Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)

2. **Request Timeout Protection** - `app/api/upload/route.ts:280`
   - 2-minute timeout to prevent hanging requests
   - `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(120000)`

3. **Enhanced Error Messages** - `app/api/upload/route.ts:349-392`
   - User-friendly error messages for common network issues
   - Specific guidance for different error types
   - Retryable flag to indicate retry possibility

4. **Frontend Error Handling** - `app/upload/page.tsx:309-332`
   - Parse and display user-friendly error messages
   - Graceful fallback for JSON parsing errors
   - Better error messaging in UI

**Error Types Handled:**
- `ECONNRESET`: "Upload failed due to network connection reset. Please check your connection and try again."
- `ETIMEDOUT`: "Upload timed out. Please try uploading a smaller image or check your internet connection."
- `ENOTFOUND`: "Could not connect to upload service. Please check your internet connection."
- `fetch failed`: "Network error occurred during upload. Please try again in a moment."

**Result:** Much more resilient upload system with automatic retries and better user feedback during network issues.
**Resolution:** Fixed delete error handling to treat 403/404 errors as success since they indicate item already deleted.

**Root Cause:** UI was sending multiple delete requests for same item. First delete succeeded, subsequent requests got 403 "item not found" which was incorrectly treated as failure.

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `lib/airtable.ts:412-419` to handle 403/404 as success
- Added logic: "item already deleted = successful deletion"
- Prevents false error messages in UI

**Files Fixed:**
- `lib/airtable.ts` (deleteQueueItem method) - Added 403/404 handling

~~ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\benja\AirTableQueueforCustomers\.next\server\app\landing\page.js'~~

**Resolution:** Fixed TypeScript compilation error in login page that was preventing the build process from completing. The issue was an invalid CSS property `focusRingColor` in app/login/page.tsx:222. After removing this property, the build completed successfully and generated the missing landing page files.

**Root Cause:** TypeScript compilation failure due to invalid CSS property preventing Next.js from generating the required .js files from .tsx sources.

**Files Fixed:**
- app/login/page.tsx (removed focusRingColor property)
- AirTableQueueforCustomers/app/login/page.tsx (removed focusRingColor property)

**Root Cause:** The Airtable base "Image Queue" table's Status field is not properly configured with the required select options that the application code expects.

**Expected Status Options:** `queued`, `processing`, `published`, `failed`
**Current Status:** Field missing these options or not configured as Single Select

**Solution Required:**
1. **Go to Airtable base:** `apps4ZTtBg4oTHLUz`
2. **Open "Image Queue" table**
3. **Configure Status field as Single Select with options:**
   - `queued` (set as default)
   - `processing`
   - `published`
   - `failed`

**Technical Details:**
- Code attempts to set `'Status': 'queued'` in lib/airtable.ts:271
- Airtable rejects with 422 error because "queued" option doesn't exist
- API key lacks permission to create new select options automatically

**Files Involved:**
- `lib/airtable.ts` (line 271) - Sets status to 'queued'
- `app/api/airtable/queue/add/route.ts` - Calls queueImage function
- `airtable-fields-reference.md` - Documents required schema

**✅ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND APPLIED:**
- Commented out Status field assignment in `lib/airtable.ts:271`
- Removed `'Status': 'queued'` from Airtable payload
- Server restarted on port 3007 with updated code
- Uploads should now work without 422 errors

**✅ FINAL RESOLUTION (2025-09-28):**
Since the Status field was permanently deleted from the Airtable base, all Status field references have been completely removed from the codebase:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed Status field from QueueItem interface** - `lib/airtable.ts:16-30`
2. **Removed Status field assignment in queueImage method** - `lib/airtable.ts:271`
3. **Removed updateQueueItemStatus method** - No longer needed since Status field doesn't exist
4. **Updated UI to show "In Queue" instead of status-based badges** - `app/upload/page.tsx:892-894`
5. **Removed all Status field references from queue display logic**

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/airtable.ts` - Removed Status field from interface, payload, and all related methods
- `app/upload/page.tsx` - Simplified queue item display to show "In Queue" status

**Result:** Upload functionality now works without Status field errors. Queue items are successfully added to Airtable without attempting to set non-existent Status field.
