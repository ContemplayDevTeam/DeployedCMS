# ✅ PRISMA DATABASE CONNECTED!

## What's Set Up:

### 🗄️ Database Connection
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL
- **Connection:** ✅ Active (1,963 conversations found)
- **Prisma Client:** ✅ Generated and ready

### 📊 Dashboard Data Source:

**Left Card - "Players & Images":**
- Pulls from `Conversation` table in Prisma
- Filtered by `experienceType` field
- Shows user info from joined `User` table
- Displays image from joined `Image` table

**Right Card - "Activity Feed":**
- Shows conversation messages
- Filtered by selected user (click interaction works)
- Most recent message per conversation shown as "notes/comments"

## 🎨 Experience Type Mapping:

| Theme | Database experienceType |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Homegrown National Park** | `art` |
| **Default** | `design v4` |

Available experience types in database:
- `art`
- `art testing`
- `art playground`
- `design v1`
- `design v2`
- `design v3`
- `design v4`
- `design testing`
- `AT`
- `Q3`

## 📂 Files Created/Modified:

1. **prisma/schema.prisma** - Database schema
2. **lib/prisma.ts** - Prisma client singleton
3. **app/api/prisma/images/route.ts** - API endpoint to query images
4. **lib/themes.ts** - Updated experience type mapping
5. **.env.local** - Added DATABASE_URL

---

## 🚀 How It Works:

1. **User logs in** → Theme detected (HNP or Default)
2. **Dashboard loads** → Calls `/api/prisma/images` with experienceType
3. **API queries Prisma:**
   ```typescript
   prisma.conversation.findMany({
     where: { experienceType: 'art' }, // for HNP theme
     include: { user: true, image: true, messages: true }
   })
   ```
4. **Dashboard displays:**
   - Left card: User thumbnails from conversations
   - Right card: Messages/activity filtered by selected user

---

## 🎯 Data Structure:

The dashboard pulls:
- **From Conversation table:**
  - `experienceType` (for filtering)
  - `imageName` (file name)
  - `createdAt` (upload date)

- **From User table (joined):**
  - `displayName` or `email` (player username)

- **From Image table (joined):**
  - `imageUrl` (Cloudinary URL for thumbnail)

- **From Message table (joined):**
  - `message` (shown as "comments/notes" in activity feed)

---

## ✅ What's Working:

- ✅ Prisma connected to Neon database
- ✅ Dashboard queries Prisma instead of Airtable for images
- ✅ Experience-based filtering (HNP → art, Default → design v4)
- ✅ Left card shows users with images
- ✅ Right card shows activity/messages
- ✅ Click interaction filters by user
- ✅ Cross-user visibility (all "art" experience users see each other)

---

## 📝 What's Still Using Airtable:

**These features still use Airtable:**
- User profile stats (total uploads, storage, subscription tier)
- Queue statistics (pending/processing/published counts)
- Image upload workflow (upload → Cloudinary → Airtable queue)

**New Prisma dashboard cards use:**
- Prisma database for conversation/image display

---

## 🧪 To Test:

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Sign in with any email
3. You should see:
   - **HNP theme users:** See conversations from "art" experience type
   - **Default theme users:** See conversations from "design v4" experience type

---

## 🔧 To Add More Experience Types:

Edit [lib/themes.ts](lib/themes.ts#L163):

```typescript
const themeToExperience: Record<string, string> = {
  'homegrownnationalpark': 'art',
  'default': 'design v4',
  'yournewtheme': 'design testing', // Add here
}
```
